                "I successfully designed and developed a fully custom BigCommerce theme from the ground up using Stencil, closely replicating the client's existing WordPress theme. The client has been using BigCommerce more than 10 years and was seeking a seamless transition to maintain a consistent brand experience across platforms. Their primary focus was on achieving a high-quality user interface (UI) and ensuring smooth, responsive functionality throughout the website.

Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the client to ensure that all aspects of the layout, design, and features met their specific expectations. The Stencil framework allowed for flexibility in customization, and I utilized it to replicate various design elements, making sure the user experience was intuitive and visually appealing.

A significant aspect of this project was ensuring the functionality aligned with the client's vision. This included optimizing navigation, product displays, and making sure the overall layout was clean and professional, improving both aesthetics and usability.

After successfully completing the project, the client was extremely happy with the result. The final theme delivered the high standards of UI and functionality they were looking for, while also staying true to their branding and operational needs."

                As a seasoned front-end developer, I had the opportunity to design and develop a custom Shopify theme for EZ Restaurant, an online store dedicated to providing high-quality disposable plastic and cardboard products. This project involved a comprehensive understanding of both user experience and aesthetic design, ensuring that the site is not only functional but also visually appealing.

The primary goal was to create an intuitive shopping experience tailored to the needs of the food service industry. I implemented responsive design principles to ensure seamless navigation across various devices, allowing customers to browse effortlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The theme prominently features a wide range of products, including disposable boxes, glasses, and utensils, with an emphasis on eco-friendly options to cater to environmentally conscious consumers.

Additionally, I optimized the site's performance, ensuring fast loading times and smooth interactions to enhance user satisfaction. Through thoughtful design elements and strategic layout choices, I highlighted the store's unique selling points, making it easy for customers to find and purchase the products they need. This project showcases my skills in Shopify theme development, attention to detail, and commitment to delivering exceptional digital solutions that meet client needs.

                I developed a custom WordPress theme specifically designed for property listing and management. Using native WordPress functions, I created a flexible and scalable Custom Post Type for properties, allowing easy input and organization of key data such as property details, images, pricing, and location. The Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin was utilized to add custom fields for each listing, ensuring the theme could support detailed and structured content management.

I implemented jQuery to enhance user interactivity, improving both the front-end experience and the back-end ease of use for content managers. Custom filtering and sorting functionality were incorporated to allow users to search properties by criteria such as price range, number of rooms, and location. The theme was built with performance and responsiveness in mind, ensuring that it functions seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

This project showcases my expertise in building custom WordPress solutions that are both functional and tailored to client requirements. My role in the Halcyon project highlights my proficiency in theme development, custom functionality integration, and creating a smooth user experience.

                I had the opportunity to develop a custom BigCommerce store for Canna River, a brand dedicated to providing high-quality CBD products. My approach focused on creating a visually appealing and highly functional online shopping experience tailored to the unique demands of the CBD market.

Using BigCommerce Stencil, I designed a fully responsive, mobile-friendly theme that aligns with Canna River's brand identity. The clean, modern aesthetics are complemented by an intuitive layout, enhancing user experience and navigation. I implemented user-friendly features, including easy product filtering and categorized navigation, allowing customers to quickly find what they are looking for.

The product pages were crafted with attention to detail, featuring high-resolution images, comprehensive descriptions, and customer reviews to build trust and encourage conversions. A streamlined checkout process was integrated to reduce cart abandonment and provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. Multiple payment options were included for convenience.

Additionally, I incorporated SEO best practices to enhance the store's visibility in search engines, driving organic traffic and improving overall sales. Since the launch, the Canna River store has experienced significant traffic growth and increased customer engagement, demonstrating the effectiveness of a well-executed eCommerce strategy.

                Tokyo International JP is a custom-built WordPress website designed specifically for car listings, aimed at creating a seamless platform for buyers and sellers in the automotive market. The site utilizes a dedicated custom post type to efficiently manage vehicle listings, making it easier for users to add, update, and view cars.

One of the standout features of Tokyo International JP is the integration of Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). This allows for the inclusion of essential details in each listing, such as the make, model, year, mileage, price, and overall condition of the vehicle. This functionality enhances the user experience, providing potential buyers with all the necessary information at a glance.

The design of the site prioritizes user experience, featuring a clean, modern layout that is fully responsive. This ensures that visitors can easily browse the listings on any device, whether it’s a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

Additionally, the site includes robust search and filter functionalities. Users can refine their search based on various criteria, including price range, make, model, and year, making it easier to find the perfect vehicle. Each listing also comes with a responsive image gallery, allowing sellers to showcase their cars effectively and attractively.
